* CloudWX Raspberry Pi

Connect to radio, listen to AWOS/ASOS transmissions, convert speech to text, parse relevant weather data.

** To build on raspberry pi
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/dprandle/cloudwx-remote.git
git submodule init && git submodule update
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -- -j
#+end_src

The executable file is called cloudwx and is generated to build/bin.


** Run sample audio
To convert the sample audio using the base english model (assuming your current directory is the top level of the project)

#+begin_src bash
$ build/bin/cloudwx -m models/ggml-base.en.bin -f sample_audio/jfk.mp3
#+end_src

You can download more models with the download-ggml-model.sh script in the models folder. See whisper.cpp repo for options for that script. After downloading another model, configure again with:

#+begin_src bash
cd build
cmake ..
#+end_src

This will copy the model to the build/bin/models folder.
